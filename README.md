# A [Hubot](https://github.com/github/hubot) adapter for [Flowdock](https://www.flowdock.com)

[Flowdock](https://www.flowdock.com/) is a web based collaboration and chat app.
It integrates nicely with GitHub, Rally, Pivotal Tracker, Twitter, JIRA,
Confluence, most CI systems and even email. Read
about [how to do ChatOps with Hubot](http://blog.flowdock.com/2014/11/11/chatops-devops-with-hubot/).

Note: this adapter has been specially modified to behave (technically) badly
just for my group's needs. I would not use this in production.
